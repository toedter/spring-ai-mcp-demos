# Spring AI MCP Demos

Several MCP demos (like an mcp server) written in Java with Spring Boot 3.5.x and Spring AI.

## How to run the mcp server

1. **Build the MCP server**

   ```sh
   ./gradlew build
   ```

2. **Download and install Claude Desktop**

    - Go to [https://claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)
    - Download the latest release for your operating system and extract it.

3. **Configure Claude Desktop**

    - Edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file.
    - Add or update the `mcpServers` section to include:

      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "demo-local": {
            "command": "java",
            "args": [
              "-jar",
              "D:\\dev\\git\\spring-ai-mcp-demos\\mcp-server\\build\\libs\\mcp-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar",
              "--spring.profiles.active=stdio"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      Adjust the path to the JAR file as needed. The example shows a Windows config.
      Then copy the file to the appropriate `claude-desktop` directory.
